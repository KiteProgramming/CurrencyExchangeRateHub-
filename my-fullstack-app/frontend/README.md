# Frontend README for My Fullstack App

# My Fullstack App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the My Fullstack App project, built using React. The frontend communicates with the Django backend to provide a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Folder Structure

- `public/`: Contains the static files, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and application logic.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite.
